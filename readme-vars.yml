  This image sets up the BOINC client and manager and makes its interface available via Guacamole server in the browser. The interface is available at `http://your-ip:8080`.

  By default, there is no password set for the main gui. Optional environment variable `PASSWORD` will allow setting a password for the user `abc`.
  
  You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using `ctrl`+`alt`+`shift` enabling you to use remote copy/paste and different languages.
  
  It is recommended to switch to `Advanced View` in the top menu, because the `Computing Preferences` don't seem to be displayed in `Simple View`.
  
  Sometimes, the pop-up windows may open in a tiny box in the upper left corner of the screen. When that happens, you can find the corner and resize them.

  ## GPU Hardware Acceleration
  
  ### Intel
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:
  ```--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri```
  We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.
  
  ### Nvidia
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:
  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the BOINC docker container.
